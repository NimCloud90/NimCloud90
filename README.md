- 👋 Hi, I’m @NimCloud90
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to program a video game, even though it looks very difficult to many, it looks fairly simple to me in concept, I just don't really know where to start lol.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if it sounds fun enough.
- 📫 How to reach me, here's my business email: thesillygayhats@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to think I'm funny (don't worry, my partner says that I am).
